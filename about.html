<h1>Hi, I'm Bojay B.</h1>
<hr><br>
<p>This website has been a personal project of mine for a handful of years now. It's an amalgamation of every idea for any website I've ever thought of (almost). I rarely update the site anymore, and when I do, it's a clip of audio from a song I like. I think I'll start linking the most recent one on the landing page from now on.
</p>
<br>
<p>I'd write more about me, but there's not much. I don't do anything other than play games really. I don't have any kind of followers on any platform. I don't make music, or art, or anything cool. I'm just me, and this is my website :)</p>
