<h1>Thank you for visiting!</h1>
<hr>
<p>This website it currently <small>(and probably always will be)</small> a <strong><big>WORK IN PROGRESS</strong></big>! Keep checking this website out to see if there have been any changes! I've been wokring on <a href="mal.html">MAL</a> more recently as I've been watching more anime. I've added some new stuff to the <a href="blog.html">Blog page</a>, and I will soon be adding some stuff to the <a href="games.html">Games page</a>! I used to have a lot of stuff in the games page before I uploaded everything to neocities, but I never expanded on any of it. I currently have an <a href="oldgames.html">oldgames page</a> that isn't normally accessable, but I'll link it here for fun! </p>
<h2>Thank you so much for snooping through my website and I hope you'll come back soon!</h2>
