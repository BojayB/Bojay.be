<p> Wow, I really do feel like a piece of shit. I come here to write about a beautiful girl, and then come back to write about a different beautiful girl... This really does make me feel like a terrible person. Who does that. Potentionally a lot of people, because feelings are weird and can be difficult to deal with. But that doesnt make me feel any better about myself.. This one's name is Mal. Well, technically. Thats not their real name, but I believe thats what they'd prefer to go by. Theyre also a they, too. I keep mistakingly calling them a she and I feel bad about it. But they're pretty, and theyre nice. I guess I just fall for people who treat me nicely and give me attention. Again, writing all this nakes me feel like a terrible person. I'm sorry. I guess I still have the same issue as before, I move way too fast. But to be fair, I think theyre moving at the same pace as me? So maybe its okay? I just need to keep in mind that if we DO become anything, that we should take it slow. Make an hinest effort to get to know eachother, genuinely. Mal, if you somehow end up reading this, this doesnt make my feelings any less true, or as if I was lying to you. I'm honest with my words and I do like you, I just feel like an ass for liking people one after another. This doesnt mean that my feelings wont last. The only way nothing would continue from here is if you move onto another man...

<p>I met this beautiful girl a couple weeks ago. She's absolutely fantastic. My only problem is that I'm already moving too fast. I already want to be in a relationship with this woman. I mean, I also don't, but I do more than I don't. I want to get to know this person. Deeper than my past instant-hookups. She's wonderful. I guess I've said that about all of my past love interests too. "She's different", yeah, okay. Not that she isn't, but I don't want to sound like 'that guy', y'know? To anyone else I've just found another girl I'm gonna waste my time with. To me, I've found my wife. Stupid stuff really. But I really like this girl. the way she looks, the way she acts, the way she talks, the way she smiles, the way she smells. All of it. Love is a crazy thing. </p>
