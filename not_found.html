    <p> This gosh darn page dunnit exist yet, or never will. Double check your spelling and try again! </p>
    <br><h2> Orrrr....</h2><p> Check out my <a href="/gone.html">loops!</a><br><p>These shitty loops are the backbone of this website. Without them, I would probably never touch this website. I put a lot (some) effort into every single one, and have fun making them!</p><br><p>It would mean a lot if you checked them out. If they don't play audio, you should either come back here and try once more, or try again when you're on your desktop! To see my other loops, click inside the small box, then on any other page it takes you to, click anywhere!</p><br><p>(Some/most browsers disable autoplay, so go into your browser settings, search auto, and look for a setting that has to do with audio, then turn that either ON or OFF!)
